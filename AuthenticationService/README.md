# Spring Security Diving Deep

In this section we will dive deep into the springboot security and go through the detailed lifecycle of a request and response for the following flows.

1 JWT authorization filter flow and exception handling.
2 For custome /login flow.
3 For OAuth2 Authentication with google.

### JWT Auth Flow

- Every request to our spring web application will land into the JWT filter.
- If the request contains the JWT token in the header it will validate.
- And if the request doesnot contain the token other filters will be triggered.
- Suppose if the token is valid then the filter loading the user details.
- After that it is creating a UsernamepasswordAuthentication token by providing the user details.
- And adds the user into the security context holder.
- This way other filters will consider the request as authenticated and not trigger the authentication entry point or access denied exception.
- And after that the servelet dispactecher will dispatch the request to the controller which matches the request mapping.
  Here is the detailed and indepth view of the JWT authentication flow.

### Custom Login Flow

- Request to /login will be sent it will pass through the filters but will not get authentication as it is permited in any case.
- /login route needs login reques which demands username and password.
- After the successful hit to the endpoint, user service method authenticate will be called.
- It works as follows:
  - It creates a UsernamepasswordAuthenticationToken.
  - Authentication Managers authenticate method will use that token.
  - Authentication Manager will find the suitable provider for authenticating.
  - In our case DaoAuthenticationProvider will be used for authentication.
  - It will load the user details which will be from userdetails service implementation.
  - LoadUser method will be called and in our case it will load the user from the database.
  - The DaoAuthenticationProvider will authenticate the user and sends authentication object back to the authentication manage.
  - This way using authentication managers object we can check it isAuthenticated is true.
  - If it is true it means the user is authenticated.
  - Now we will generate the token and send token as a response.
  - If in some case the authentication is failed a BadCredentialsException will be thrown which will be handled by the RestControllerAdvice.
    Here is the detailed and indepth view of the Custome login flow.

### OAuth2 Login

- To login using OAuth2 we have to hit a specific url for the respective autherization servers like for google we will call.
  - /oauth2/authorization/google
- When user call this url it will pass through the filters.
- The OAuth2 Login filter will trigger the OAuth2 login flow.
- The following flow will then happen.
  - As external autherization servers are in this flow we will be redirected to external urls.
  - And on success we need to redirect back to our frontend.
  - Especially when we have session management set to stateless.
  - So we need to store the redirect_uri somewhere in order to refirect to it.
  - We used cookies http only cookies for this case.
  - AutherizationRequestRepository will come into place for handling this.
  - The request first lands to this repository and we are saving the request in the cookies using the saveAuthorizationRequest method.
  - After the request come back to our application the removeAuthorizationRequest will be called at that time we are returning the request as we recieved it previously.
  - After that our userInfo configuration comes into place and saves the authenticated user into the database.
  - And after that successhandler will generate the JWT token, take out the redirect_uri from the cookies and redirect the user to the url specifiec in redirect_url.
